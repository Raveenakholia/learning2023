    This is my learning journey for the 2023 and it includes step by step and
    the path I have followed for my Switch.

  <h1>Absolute File Paths? ====> (From w3 Schools)</h1>
  <p>
    An absolute file path is the full URL to a file: For Example ==>
    <img
      src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg"
      alt="Mountain" />
  </p>

  <h1>Relative File Paths? ===></h1>
  <p>
    A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page. # In the
    following example, the file path points to a file in the images folder
    located at the root of the current web: # Example ======> #
    <img
      src="/images/picture.jpg"
      alt="Mountain" />
  </p>
</body>
